        Cirrhosis is a complex liver disease characterized by extensive liver tissue scarring, often resulting from chronic conditions such as viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Predicting the diverse outcomes of cirrhosis, ranging from stable conditions to complications such as liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma, poses a significant challenge for clinicians. This project proposes an integrative machine learning approach for multi-class prediction of cirrhosis outcomes based on diverse clinical, demographic, and laboratory parameters. Dataset comprises a diverse cohort of cirrhosis patients, including information on etiology, comorbidities, laboratory test results, and imaging data. To enhance predictive accuracy, feature techniques to extract relevant information from the raw data. Subsequently, a multi-class classification model is trained using machine learning algorithms. Performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are employed to evaluate the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between various cirrhosis outcomes. Additionally, interpretability of the model is addressed through feature importance analysis, shedding light on the key factors influencing the predictions. This knowledge can aid clinicians in understanding the underlying patterns contributing to diverse cirrhosis outcomes and inform personalized treatment strategies.
